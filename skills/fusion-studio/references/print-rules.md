# Print rules (starting points, not guarantees)

These are conservative defaults for a 0.4 mm nozzle and 0.2 mm layers. Every value is a **parameter** in the model so a test print can correct it. Where a number depends on the filament brand or the printer's calibration, it says so. Sources: [materials.md](materials.md#sources). The slicer check is in [slicer.md](slicer.md).

## Printer: Bambu Lab H2C (default)

- Build volume reported as 305 x 320 x 325 mm for single-nozzle printing, 300 x 320 x 325 mm dual-nozzle, 330 x 320 x 325 mm total across both nozzles. Sources disagree by a few millimetres on the left-nozzle height, so check Bambu's spec page before printing anything near the edge. `fx_lib.report()` checks bodies against 305 x 320 x 325.
- Hotend up to 350 C, heated bed up to 120 C, active chamber heating to 65 C, hardened-steel nozzles in 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mm.
- Multi-material through nozzle swapping (Vortek). A single-colour part does not care.
- Source: Bambu Lab's [H2C announcement](https://blog.bambulab.com/bambu-lab-h2c-where-multi-material-vortek-system-meets-engineering-precision) and independent reviews. Re-check if the user has a different firmware or bed plate.

## Material and fits

The material sets the fits and the limits for wall thickness, overhang angle and bridge length. Those live in [materials.md](materials.md) and `assets/materials.json`, and `print_profile("PETG")` turns them into parameters. Fits are **diametral** (total across both sides), not per side. Per-side clearance is half. Calibrate with `fit_coupon()`. Never apply a global shrink percentage.

Small round holes print undersized. Add `hole_comp` (0.15 to 0.25 mm by material) to holes under about 6 mm and to magnet pockets, then test.

## Geometry

- Wall thickness: at least 3 perimeters (1.2 mm). Use multiples of 0.4 so the slicer does not leave gaps. 2.4 mm gives 6 perimeters.
- Minimum feature: 0.8 mm for anything that must survive handling. 0.4 mm details exist but break.
- Overhangs: the limit is per material (35 to 55 degrees from vertical in the profile). A small shelf under about 5 mm is usually fine. Bridges: the limit is per material (10 to 30 mm). `print_check()` reports both. Say so when you accept one.
- Corners: radius 1 mm or more on outer vertical corners. Sharp interior corners crack, add a 0.5 mm fillet.
- First layer: a 0.4 to 0.6 mm chamfer on bed-contact edges stops elephant foot and splay. Fillet edges normal to the bed to reduce warping.
- Holes for keyrings: 4 mm minimum, 5 mm comfortable, with at least 3 mm of material around.
- Tensile loads go across layer lines, never along: a keyring eye should lie flat on the bed so the layers run around the hole.
- Text and logos: emboss or deboss at least 0.6 mm deep and 1 mm stroke.

## Orientation checklist (state it in the handover)

1. Which face is on the bed.
2. Where supports are needed (aim for none).
3. Which direction layers run relative to the main load.
4. Which bridges exist and how long.
5. What surface finish the visible face gets (bed side is smoother with a smooth plate, the top is layered).

## Hardware

Magnets, screws and heat-set inserts are measured and parameterised like anything else. Ask the user for the real diameter and thickness, add 0.1 to 0.2 mm radial clearance for glue-in magnets, and say which magnet polarity the design assumes. Inserts need the maker's hole size: ask for the datasheet value.
